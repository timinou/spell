defmodule PtcRunner.TraceLog do
  @moduledoc """
  Captures SubAgent execution events to JSONL files for offline analysis.

  TraceLog attaches to SubAgent telemetry events and writes them to a JSONL file,
  enabling detailed debugging and performance analysis of agent executions.

  ## Usage

  The simplest way to capture a trace is with `with_trace/2`:

      {:ok, {:ok, step}, trace_path} = TraceLog.with_trace(fn ->
        SubAgent.run(agent, llm: my_llm())
      end)

      # Analyze the trace
      events = TraceLog.Analyzer.load(trace_path)
      summary = TraceLog.Analyzer.summary(events)

  For more control, use `start/1` and `stop/1`:

      {:ok, collector} = TraceLog.start(path: "my_trace.jsonl")
      {:ok, step} = SubAgent.run(agent, llm: my_llm())
      {:ok, path, errors} = TraceLog.stop(collector)

  ## Event Format

  Each line in the JSONL file is a JSON object with:

      {
        "event": "run.start",           # Event type (run|turn|llm|tool).(start|stop|exception)
        "trace_id": "abc123...",        # Unique trace identifier
        "timestamp": "2024-01-...",     # ISO 8601 timestamp
        "measurements": {...},          # Telemetry measurements
        "metadata": {...},              # Event-specific metadata
        "duration_ms": 123              # Duration (for stop events)
      }

  ## Process Isolation and Cross-Process Propagation

  Traces are isolated by process. Only events from the process that called `start/1`
  are captured. This allows multiple concurrent traces without interference.

  Nested traces are supported - each `with_trace` call creates its own trace file,
  and events are routed to the innermost active collector.

  ### Cross-Process Tracing

  When execution spans multiple processes (e.g., parallel tasks), use
  `join/2` to propagate trace context to child processes:

      collectors = TraceLog.active_collectors()
      parent_span = PtcRunner.SubAgent.Telemetry.current_span_id()

      Task.async(fn ->
        TraceLog.join(collectors, parent_span)
        # Events from this process are now captured AND linked to parent
      end)

  **Note:** The sandbox process inherits trace collectors via `join/2`, so tool
  telemetry events (`tool.start`, `tool.stop`) emitted inside the sandbox are
  captured directly by the trace handler.

  Starts trace collection for the current process.

  Returns a collector process that will capture all SubAgent telemetry events
  from this process until `stop/1` is called.

  ## Options

    * `:path` - File path for the JSONL output. Defaults to a timestamped file.
    * `:trace_id` - Custom trace identifier. Defaults to a random hex string.
    * `:trace_kind` - Trace type discriminator (e.g., `"benchmark"`, `"analysis"`).
    * `:producer` - Component that created this trace (e.g., `"demo.benchmark"`).
    * `:trace_label` - Human-readable label (e.g., test case name).
    * `:model` - LLM model identifier.
    * `:query` - Input query or question.
    * `:meta` - Producer-specific metadata under `data`.

  Joins the current process to existing trace collectors.

  This is used for trace propagation across process boundaries. When spawning
  child processes (via Task.async_stream, Process.spawn, etc.), the parent's
  trace collectors are not automatically inherited. Call this function at the
  start of the child process to re-attach to the parent's trace session.

  ## Parameters

    * `collectors` - List of collector PIDs to join (from `active_collectors/0`)
    * `parent_span_id` - Optional span ID from parent process for span hierarchy

  ## Example

      # In parent process
      collectors = TraceLog.active_collectors()

  ## Notes

  - Only joins collectors that are still alive (stale PIDs are filtered out)
  - Does not attach telemetry handlers (they are global and already attached)
  - Safe to call multiple times or with an empty list
  - When `parent_span_id` is provided, sets up span hierarchy so new spans
    in this process have the parent span as their parent_span_id

  @doc """
  Writes a serialized event map to the innermost active collector in the
  calling process's collector stack.

  Used by call sites that need to emit a custom JSONL line from outside
  the SubAgent telemetry path (e.g., the MCP server recording per-call
  outcomes). The event map is forwarded as-is to
  `PtcRunner.TraceLog.Collector.write_event/2`, which assigns a `seq`,
  encodes via `PtcRunner.TraceLog.Event.encode/1`, and appends a JSONL
  line.

  Returns `:ok` if a collector was active and the event was queued for
  writing, or `:no_collector` if no `with_trace/2` / `start/1` scope is
  active in this process.

  This function never raises. Errors during forwarding are swallowed
  (writes are async casts; encoding failures degrade gracefully).
