defmodule PtcRunner.Lisp.Runtime do
  @moduledoc """
  Built-in functions for PTC-Lisp.

  Provides collection operations, map operations, arithmetic, string manipulation,
  and type predicates. This module acts as the public API and delegates to
  focused submodules:

  - `Runtime.FlexAccess` - Flexible key access helpers
  - `Runtime.Collection` - Collection operations (filter, map, reduce, etc.)
  - `Runtime.MapOps` - Map operations (get, assoc, merge, etc.)
  - `Runtime.String` - String manipulation and parsing
  - `Runtime.Math` - Arithmetic operations
  - `Runtime.Predicates` - Type and numeric predicates
