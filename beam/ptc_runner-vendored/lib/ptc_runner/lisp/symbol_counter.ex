  Counts unique user-defined symbols and keywords in a parsed Lisp AST.

  Used to enforce the `max_symbols` limit, preventing atom table exhaustion

  Core language symbols (special forms like `if`, `let`, `fn`) are excluded
  from the count since they're predefined and don't contribute to atom exhaustion.
